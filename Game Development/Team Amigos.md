## About Project

egg catcher using pygame and python 3 (An egg catcher game tests your concentration and the speed of your reflexes as you have to catch eggs falling all around the screen with one basket. To create an egg catcher game we have to design an animation of falling eggs at random positions and a basket that will be catching all the falling eggs.

To create an eggs catcher game using Python, our first step will be to design a floor, basket, and eggs. Once our game starts, the eggs will gradually move across the floor, which will create an animation indicating that the eggs are falling. Then with the help of loops, we can constantly check that the eggs have been caught in the basket or have touched the ground. When the egg is caught or dropped, it will be an end of an event, so here the egg will be removed and the game has to adjust the score by increasing the score if the egg was caught in the basket or by decreasing our one life if the egg has touched the ground.)
