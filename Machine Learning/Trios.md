## About Project

The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price. To train our machine learning model with Boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learn Boston dataset.
In this dataset, each row describes a Boston town or suburb. There are 506 rows and 13 attributes (features) with a target column (price).
Further we may include some more features to make this project of more advanced level.
