This is a business project useful for business professionals.
This model will help the businessman to predict the sales amount  for next month in a scientific way so that they can plan the budget accordingly.

In this project, we are taking the  sales amount  of a company for last 2 years  and preparing a model
that will  predict the  total sales for every product of the company  for next month.
The main data science technique used in this time series forecasting is the ARIMA model and  Python language
is used to train the model. ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average.
