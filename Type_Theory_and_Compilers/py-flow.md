## About Project

**PyFlow** is a static analysis tool for the Python programming language that works without needing
any type annotations. It performs flow sensitive type analysis and and is capable of inferring type 
information from code using [Hindley Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system) type inference and a unification algorithm.

This project attempts to demonstrate that better tooling is possible for duck-typed languages without
needing an extra layer of traspilation with languages like Typescript or Flow.

PyFlow watches the filesystem for changes in source code and reports errors as soon as it encounters them.

**Tech stack**:

	- Python
	- Numpy
